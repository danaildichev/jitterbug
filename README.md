Do you want to:

- create a sense of urgency on your landing pages?
- make it look like people are actively interested in your products?
- and have customized control over it
- without spending time and money building a real data stream?

Then you should add some dynamic jitter to your web pages. You can decide how much and how often:

- your "products sold" will rise
- and your "page views" will fluctuate

The best part about Jitter Bug is that these updates look and feel organic. Its timers trigger these changes at different intervals. Jitter Bug can be configured with default or custom settings for one or more products on a page. Your "page views" will bounce between a high and low value while your "products sold" will gradually increase. The numbers displayed for "page views" will be updated in unison for all instances, while the numbers for "products sold" will be updated individually and at different times. Jitter Bug's settings allow you to decide where those numbers start, how much, and how often those values will be updated.
